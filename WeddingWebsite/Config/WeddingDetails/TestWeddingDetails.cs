/// This file provides a git-tracked up-to-date selection of data suitable for development.
/// 
/// This is useful for:
///  - Trying out the website without needing to enter all your own information first.
///  - Seeing an example as this can be helpful when constructing your own implementation.
///  - Sharing screenshots of layout without revealing anything about your wedding.
///  - A standardized test environment to diagnose problems.
///  - Updates automatically with new releases so you can test out new releases before filling in details.
///  - Will facilitate any future unit testing that may be added.
///
/// In practice, you won't actually be using this implementation but I'd recommend keeping it around in case you need it.
